Jenkins inbound agent + php for legacy freestyle jobs that cannot specify a container and need to have all environment dependencies built into the core container.

If you're using modern Pipeline jobs, see instead the config at:

https://github.com/HariSekhon/Jenkins

for how to more easily just add additional containers and specify which one to execute inside>
